# graphql-pg-mongo
Sandbox for me and the team, based on [Ben Awad's helpful tutorial](https://github.com/benawad/postgres-mongo-graphql-example "Ben's repo").

## To try it out
1. If you haven't already, run `npm install` to install the necessary packages for the program.
2. Run `npm start`
3. Point your browser to localhost:4000/graphql
4. You should see Apollo's playground interface render on your screen
5. Run GraphQL queries on left, see responses on right
    - Create tabs to organize query examples for demo purposes, if you'd like!
